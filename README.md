# Nichesphere

Nichesphere is an sc-verse compatible Python library which allows the user to find differentially co-localized cellular niches based on cell type pairs co-localization probabilities in 
different conditions. Cell type pair co-localization probabilities are obtained from deconvoluted spatial transcriptomics / PIC-seq data (probabilities of finding each cell type in each spot 
/ multiplet) as the probabilities to find each cell type pair in the same spot/multiplet. 

It also offers the possibility to look at biological process based differential communication among cellular niches based on Ligand-Receptor pairs expression data, such as results from CrossTalkeR [ref.].
